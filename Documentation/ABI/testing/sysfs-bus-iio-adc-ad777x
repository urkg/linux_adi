Description:
		Reading returns a list with the possible filter modes. Only supported by
		AD7771.

		  * "sinc3"	- The digital sinc3 filter implements three main notches, one at
				the maximum ODR (128 kHz or 32 kHz, depending on the
				power mode) and another two at the ODR frequency selected to
				stop noise aliasing into the pass band.

		  * "sinc5"	- The sinc5 filter implements five notches, one at
				the maximum ODR (128 kHz or 32 kHz, depending on the
				power mode) and another four at the ODR frequency
				selected to stop noise aliasing into the pass band.

Description:
		Reading returns a list with the possible number of output lines on which
		data is shifted.

			* "4_data_lines"- The data is sent on all 4 output data lines,
					two channels on each.

			* "2_data_lines"- The data is sent on the first two output data lines,
					four channels on each.

			* "1_data_line" - The data from all the channels is sent only on the
					first output data line.
